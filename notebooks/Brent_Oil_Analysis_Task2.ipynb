    "# Detailed Implementation Plan\n",
    "1. **Adapt Knowledge from Task 1**: Advanced Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective: Build on initial time series methods by applying both univariate and multivariate models to capture dependencies and potential regime changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approach: Implement models like `VAR` and `Markov-Switching ARIMA` to handle market condition changes and dependencies among economic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect Economic, Technological, and Political Data\n",
    "Data Source**: Use `wbdata` to pull indicators such as GDP, inflation, and exchange rates for major economies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration: Add the new data to the original dataset and use merge_economic_data() to prepare for multivariate analysis."
